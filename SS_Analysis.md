### SS Analysis

### Ideas:  
1. Occupancy
2. Phenology (want 8D files for this)
3. Correlation with other params?
4. Other datasets to compare? 
5. Fisheries?
6. Zooplankton in the Keys?
7. 


### Notes on Downscaling

Need to get two products from physical model(s) (start w/Yonggang)
1. ADT
2. SSS
Questions:
1. What time periods do we need? - All of MODIS record, if possible
2. Daily resolution
3. Need to aggregate to regular grid?
4. Does OCG have climatologies already?
5. FVCOM vs WFCOM?
6. Does not include Biscayne Bay.

### Notes on SS continuity project and poster for IOCS meeting in November 2023
Products:
1. Chla
2. SST4
3. adg443
4. nflh
5. Rrs - 412,443,488,531,547,667,678

Ideas for comparisons
1. Raw VIIRS vs. MODIS comparisons (2013 through mid-2023). Where? Use 4-km 8D global files. Check w/Joaquin.
2. Seascape mode comparisons
3. Rrs comarisons - are certain bands more of an issue than others?
4. nflh from MODIS compared to FLH from OLCI. Need OLCI from Joaquin.
