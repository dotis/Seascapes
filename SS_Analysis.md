### SS Analysis

### Ideas:  
1. Occupancy
2. Phenology (want 8D files for this)
3. Correlation with other params?
4. Other datasets to compare? 
5. Fisheries?
6. Zooplankton in the Keys?
7. 


### Notes on Downscaling

Need to get two products from physical model(s) (start w/Yonggang)
1. ADT
2. SSS
Questions:
1. What time periods do we need? - All of MODIS record, if possible
2. Daily resolution
3. Need to aggregate to regular grid?
4. Does OCG have climatologies already?
5. FVCOM vs WFCOM?
