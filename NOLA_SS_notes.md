### Notes on SS from NOLA MBON meeting in March 2024

1. From MTK: Habitat diversity index? 
2. What ss-based product can we generate relatively quickly across MBON nodes?
3. Use 5-km global MODIS products (don't make new products)
4. Need to re-visit goals for working group
5. Product-based (what can we produce relatively quickly? - on the order of 6 months to a year)
6. Need ROI/bounding box for each node - ask for at next WG meeting
